# Transformer Model Implementation

This repository implements a Transformer model from scratch based on the [Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/). 

The implementation is supposed to be runnable on a MacBook Air. Modification from original implementation is required.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a clear, line-by-line implementation of the Transformer architecture on a Macbook Air, allowing for a deeper understanding of its components and functionality. 

## Requirements

Before running the code, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch 2.0
- Other libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file


## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/energyminimizer/transformer_with_pytorch.git
   cd transformer_with_pytorch
   ```

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Modify the code as necessary for compatibility with your system.

## Usage

Instructions for running the model will be provided here once the implementation is fully functional.
